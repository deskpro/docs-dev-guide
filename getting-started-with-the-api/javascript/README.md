Welcome to the Deskpro API. This section will guide you through creating a simple ticket form with PHP, from start to finish.

The first step is to create an [API Key](../../api-basics/auth/api-keys.md). Go to _Admin &gt; Apps &gt; API Keys_ to create an API Key for yourself.

Next:

1. Create a new directory on your computer
2. Create an `index.html` file

For example, from the command-line it might look something like this:

```bash
$ mkdir article-form
$ cd article-form/
$ touch index.html
```
