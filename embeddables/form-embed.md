Ticket Form Embed
=================

The form embed embeds a new ticket form directly into any page on your website. The embedded form has all of the power of the normal Deskpro form including dynamic custom fields, validation, etc.

To embed a ticket form on your site:

1. Log in to your _Admin Interface_.
2. Navigate to _User Interface -> Ticket Form Widget_.
3. Customize the widget as you see fit. Click _Get Code_.
4. Copy the code to your clipboard.
6. Paste this code into your webpage. Paste the code in the actual position on the page that you want the form to appear.
